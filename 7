## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
**Career:** 
My insights into modern development workflows and teamwork will be useful in my professional career. Some insights from notes include:

- Stand up meeting was succesful in quickly getting everyone on the same page. It can be taken both informally and formally which makes it very dynamic for any workspace.

**Employability:** 
I should continue to practice my group and organisational skills as these are very important, I should utilise Trello and other workflow methods on my day to day basis. 

The These skills are preparing for the industry.


**Learning insights:**
I learnt how PHP is the engine responsible for 90% of online sites and how it offers a different perspective to creating websites. It's more flexibile but hard to start without a template. PHP code is very scalable and easy to code.
