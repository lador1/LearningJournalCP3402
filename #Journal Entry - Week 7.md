## Estimated Hours
- Around 5 hours

## Content Insights 
I learnt the following:

- How to Echo HTML for outputting ontent on web pages. In the Supercars website, echoing HTML allows me to display dynamic information such as car details, rental prices, and confirmation messages.

- How to implement decision statements. They are Extremely useful in php, in the Supercars website, if/else statements are used to display different content based on the selected car, or show error messages if no valid car is selected, work with variables.

- How to call on functions in decision statements - such as different output messages as functions.

- I was unsuccesful at implementing loops however I have understanding of how these could be implemented. Foreach loops can be utilized to display a list of available cars, while for loops can be used for generating numbered lists or iterating over a range of values.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
**Career:** 
My insights into modern development workflows and teamwork will be useful in my professional career. Some insights from notes include: Stand up meeting was succesful in quickly getting everyone on the same page. It can be taken both informally and formally which makes it very dynamic for any workspace.

PHP coding skills will be useful in a future career of website developments, while these skills are basic PHP is scaleable and easy to learn.
  

**Employability:** 
I should continue to practice my group and organisational skills as these are very important, I should utilise Trello and other workflow methods on my day to day basis. 

**Learning insights:**
I learnt how PHP is the engine responsible for 90% of online sites and how it offers a different perspective to creating websites. It's more flexibile but hard to start without a template. PHP code is very scalable and easy to code.
