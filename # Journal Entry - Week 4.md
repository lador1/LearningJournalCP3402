## Content Insights 
- Localhosting allows for the editing of CMS without an internet connection and seemed to perform better compared to remote servers. It also offered more customization of the environment including during setup and for server configuration. To setup local hosting, docker was used as Vagrant was harder to implement and Virtual Box software was not as nice as the desktop docker. The documentation provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/official-documentation-samples/wordpress/) was useful.

- Local hosting enhances plugin use such as FG Joomla to wordpress to copy a joomla site identically into wordpress (this deleted my wordpress by accident and didnt work). Once Joomla has been succesfully hosted locally like wordpressm this is expected to work better. Futhermore third party plugins are not available through the WordPress.com platform, self hosted wordpress has no limitations.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
**Career:** 
- My understanding of localhosting has improved (Still struggling to host Joomla). But I now understand the importance of localhosting and workflow, how localhosting is essential in professional website development. I will be using this whenever I create new websites in the future.


**Employability:** 
- Localhosting/ Deployment is essential practice in professional website development to ensure quality and security of code and proper workflow practices. Fine tuning my skills will make me appealing to future employers.


**Learning insights:**
- I have learnt that local hosting is the best way to develop a website before publishing or staging futher changes. I have learnt the basics of deployment and version control integration with systems like git.
