# Journal Entry - Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
- **Resources used:** 
  - ChatGPT for CSS styling and quick prompt changes such as resizing an image.
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/): Used for some simple formatting and text resizing.
  - [Bootstrap Album](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/album/): Utilized Bootstrap for the template.
  - VS Code and GitHub for coding and publishing.

## Estimated Hours
- Spent over an hour researching startups and brainstorming ideas.
- Spent at least 4 hours coding.
- The main time-consuming part of this practical was getting Git to work, about another hour was spent troubleshooting.

## Content Insights
- It was reiterated that HTML and markup coding techniques are still necessary/important in modern website design. They are the fundamentals and are what CMS and APIs use behind the scenes.
- I found that coding with HTML is addictive and satisfying. It's very scalable and reusable for basic to decent websites. The hard part is CSS formatting and styling of images, etc.
- Using Bootstrap, a non-CMS technology, is very effective, and I will be using this in the future.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- **Career:** The content this week was oriented towards creating a startup business and enabled me to consider my real-world ideas and business plans. The startup company Vinovate was inspired by a wine bar which my housemate is looking to open in cooperation with his family's winery.
- **Employability:** The refresher on HTML and markup skills was beneficial to me. I have been managing a CMS at my job, and these skills may come in handy.
- **Learning insights:** I found that relearning HTML was much easier than the first time and took me less time to get a start on coding. CSS, on the other hand, was very difficult.

## Issues/Concerns 
Using VS Code, I initially had set up git and was committing changes and pushing these to my GitHub repository. An issue arose when I couldn't push my commits and my git kept crashing. To get past this, I created a new repository, added the files to GitHub manually, and then committed changes to CSS files there. This was also very time-consuming and affected the quality of the website.
