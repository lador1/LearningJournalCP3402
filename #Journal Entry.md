# Journal Entry - Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
#Coding#
- This week I had to relearn essential coding skills using HTML markup.

## Estimated Hours
- Spent over an hour researching start ups, brainstorming ideas.
- Spent at least 4 hours coding
- The main time consuming part of this practical was getting git to work, about another hour was spent troubleshooting.


## Content Insights
- It was reiterated that HTML and markup coding techniques are still nessecary / important in modern website design. They are the fundementals and are what CMS and API's use behind the scenes.
- I found that coding with HTML is addictive and satisfying, its very scalable and reusable for basic to decent websites. The hard part is CSS formatting and styling of images etc.
  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- (Career) The content this week was orientated towards creating a startup business and enabled me to consider my real world ideas and business plans. The startup company Vinovate was inspired by a wine bar which my housemate is looking to open in cooperation with his families winery. 
-(Employability) The refresher on HTML and markup skills was benefical to me - I have been managing a CMS at my job and these skills may come in handy. 
- (Learning insights) I found that relearning HTML was much easier than the first time and took me less time to get a start on coding. CSS on the other hand was very difficult.
