# Journal Entry - Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
Resources used: 
- ChatGPT for CSS styling and quick prompt changes such as resizing an image.
- https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - some simple formatting and text resizing
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/album/ Bootstrap album for template
- VS Code and Github for coding and publishing


## Estimated Hours
- Spent over an hour researching start ups, brainstorming ideas.
- Spent at least 4 hours coding
- The main time consuming part of this practical was getting git to work, about another hour was spent troubleshooting.


## Content Insights
- It was reiterated that HTML and markup coding techniques are still nessecary / important in modern website design. They are the fundementals and are what CMS and API's use behind the scenes.
- I found that coding with HTML is addictive and satisfying, its very scalable and reusable for basic to decent websites. The hard part is CSS formatting and styling of images etc.
- Using Bootstrap, a non CMS technology is very effective and I will be using this in the future.
  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- (Career) The content this week was orientated towards creating a startup business and enabled me to consider my real world ideas and business plans. The startup company Vinovate was inspired by a wine bar which my housemate is looking to open in cooperation with his families winery.

-(Employability) The refresher on HTML and markup skills was benefical to me - I have been managing a CMS at my job and these skills may come in handy. 

- (Learning insights) I found that relearning HTML was much easier than the first time and took me less time to get a start on coding. CSS on the other hand was very difficult.

## Issues/Concerns 
Using VS code, I initally had setup git and was committing changes and pushing these to my github repository. An issue arose when I couldnt push my commits and my git kept crashing. To get past this, I created a new repository, added the files to github manually and then committed changes to CSS files there. This was also very time consuming and affected the quality of the website.
