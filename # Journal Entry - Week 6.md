## Content Insights 
This weeks learning activities were very self directed in terms of professional development and project management. I have enhanced my skills and insights, particularly in teamwork, and professional development; by utilising tools for progression tracking (Trello) and collaboration by setting up Github and Discord integration. Actively networking on LinkedIn has also been insightful, by connecting with more people I can view their profiles and see their employment history and what they've done to get to where they are.
