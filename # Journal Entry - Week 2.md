## Content Insights
- This was my first experiences working with a CMS. My first impressions of Joomla were negative, I did not like the software and found it hard to understand what was going on. The LinkedInLearning was time consuming and while these taught me essential features, many of these couldn't be implemented with the type of website I wanted to make.
- Solidifed a basic understanding of how articles and categories work together
- Experience working with plugins and joomla configurations


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- **Career:** I believe that having a solid understanding of a CMS platform will be beneficial in my profession. Not only in terms of a diverse skillset, but specialization in Joomla-specific roles such as Joomla developer or consultant etc. I feel like Joomla has alot of potential and can be improved.


- **Employability:** Versatility in CMS Mastery: My solid understanding of Joomla showcases adaptability and versatility to potential employers. In future weeks I will have proficiency in multiple CMS systems and demonstrate a broader skill set. My ability to learn Joomla in a couple days is also a credit to my problem solving and technical ability.


- **Learning insights:**
  I reflected on the importance of time management and prioritization to ensure not only a timely completion of my work but to make sure im not rushing content and actually learning and not missing steps. This will be important as rewatching videos/tutorials for things that I have covered is time consuming and not professional. I can see the potential of using CMS and I am now excited to learn others like WordPress.
