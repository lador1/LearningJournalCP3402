## Estimated Hours

## Content Insights - WordPress

- Following a structured workflow rather than viewing individual videos for certain topics -
I felt more efficient and also remembered more. This was recommended by the LinkedIn video.

- Gained insights into commerce with WordPress -  payment integration for a product or service and performance monitoring through plug ins or wordpress built in site health and security tracker.

- Understand how user roles and permission can be implemented - Vinovate will utilize.

- Different use of themes was refreshing and made site editing safer and easier to see what I was doing - less overwhelming than changing whole themes, allowed me to incoorporate multiple themes and keep code that I liked if I wanted to change it back.


## Content Insights - Group Interviews 
- Revising an interview process was beneficial to me, key ideas such as what to do in interviews and how to prepare was reinfoced.
  
- It was insightful to be in the role of the interviewer for once and not the interviewee. I had to be adaptable and specific to different types of people, but also be fair in judgement to pick sutable group members.

- Some individuals did not know how to react when asked a question they could not answer and started to panic, on the other hand, some individals were honest and said that they couldnt relate or answer my question. 
  
- Some interviewees prioritize people who complete more work, others prefer those who present themselves better like being on time or enthusiasm towards a project, communication and collaboration.
  
- Similar personalities and skill sets can actually negatively impact the harmony of a group - and diverse teams may be beneficial depending on the task.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- **Career:** 
My new knowledge of commerce integration and advanced site control will be useful if i decide to create an online/startup company and can also be useful for pursueing website development. 

- **Employability:** 
A basic wordpress knowledge is expected by employers, I believe that I demonstrate proficiency in WordPress and other CMS. I have shown adaptability when I work between sites and make similar websites on different CMS, also, I'm starting to utilise advanced tools like plugins and commerce -this makes me attractive to employers seeking website developers and even individuals such as those wanting a website for a business etc.

- **Learning insights:** 
-   Functionality of wordpress is significantly better than Joomla CMS and much easier and user friendly experience. Learning how to use certain features such as changing fonts themes and uploading media was easier to do.
- I relearnt important things to do during an interview process and learnt about things that I do and dont want in my group members that I had not considered previously.
- Im confident in the role of an interviewer and have learnt about both sides of the interview process.
